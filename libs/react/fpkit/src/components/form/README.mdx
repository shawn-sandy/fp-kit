# Form Components

This directory contains a set of React components for building forms in web applications. The components are designed to be reusable, accessible, and customizable.

## Overview

The main components in this directory are:

- `Form`: A wrapper component for creating HTML forms with various input fields.
- `Input`: A component for rendering input fields of different types (text, email, password, etc.).
- `Textarea`: A component for rendering a textarea input field.
- `Select`: A component for rendering a dropdown select input field with options.
- `Field`: A component for rendering a label and an input field together.

These components are built with accessibility and customization in mind, providing props for setting labels, placeholders, validation, and styling.

## Usage

To use these components in your React application, import them from the respective files:

```jsx
import { Form, Input, Textarea, Select, Field } from './path/to/form/components';
```

Then, you can use them in your JSX like any other React component:

```jsx

<Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <Field label="Name" labelFor="name">
    <Input id="name" name="name" required />
  </Field>
  <Field label="Email" labelFor="email">
    <Input id="email" name="email" type="email" required />
  </Field>
  <Field label="Message" labelFor="message">
    <Textarea id="message" name="message" required />
  </Field>
  <Select id="option" name="option" required>
    <Select.Option value="option1">Option 1</Select.Option>
    <Select.Option value="option2">Option 2</Select.Option>
  </Select>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</Form>
```

## Key Features

- **Accessibility**: The components are built with accessibility in mind, providing props for setting labels, placeholders, and ARIA attributes.
- **Validation**: The `Input`, `Textarea`, and `Select` components support validation through the `required` prop.
- **Styling**: The components can be styled using CSS classes or inline styles passed through props.
- **Customization**: The components are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to pass additional props or render custom content within them.

## Styling

The components in this directory are styled using a combination of CSS modules and inline styles. The styles can be overridden or extended by importing the corresponding CSS files or by passing custom styles through the `styles` prop.

For example, to override the styles for the `Input` component, you can import the CSS file and define your custom styles:

```jsx
import './input.css';

// ...

<Input id="name" name="name" required styles={{ color: 'red' }} />
```
